everything's in the notebook
to be honest i dont even know if this is a real markov model???
I looked at three sentences and was like "yeah sure i can do this"

info on markov models:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_model
might actually be one of these?:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain

Advantages:
  Easy to implement
  Quicker to run (in most cases?)
Disadvantages:
  Larger Models take up more space than DNNs
  Larger Models can be slower than DNNs
  "Overfits" almost constantly with smaller corpora


i dont know the difference and didn't do any research beforehand because honestly i didn't care to learn about these
i usually use deep learning anyway like

rnns



and stuff

-spronkoid

p.s. fiddle around with the 'input_length' variable
lower tends to yield results that are further from the dataset in my experience
and higher tends to emulate the same action as 'overfitting' in dnns

and yes i know it wasn't implemented correctly with like, probabilities or something but i wanted to get it done as quick as possible and to be honest i couldn't give two shits
